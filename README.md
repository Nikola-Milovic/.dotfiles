# My setup

**TODO**: Format in a table and display nicer

I have a highly customized setup that makes me the most comfortable working long hours in front of the computer. All of these dotfiles and configs can be found over at my [.dotfiles](https://github.com/Nikola-Milovic/.dotfiles)

- ⌨️ [Kinesis Advantage 2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/), very durable and comfortable keyboard, doesn't have RGB! Very much a recommendation if you have any kind of wrist issues and are looking for a simple ergonomic keyboard
  - My keyboard layout with slight modifications is [real-prog-dvorak](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards), I've moved `<esc>` key to `<caps lock>` to be easily reachable by my pinky. I've swapped around `home/end`s as well with `page up/down`. This layout, combined with Kinesis, resulted in me not having wrist pain and discomfort anymore.
- 💻 Ryzen 9 9950x, 64GB DDR5 6000, 2TB NVMe M.2 PCIe 4 SSD 
- NixOS (running out of emojis), Sway + Wayland
- Neovim IDE
